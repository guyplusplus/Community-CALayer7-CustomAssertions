# Community-CALayer7-CustomAssertions

This repository is for the community to create and develop new Custom Assertions that will be deployed on the CA Layer7 API Gateway.

Layer7 API Gateway is a fine tool, though a number of features are not available, and custom script assertion is still not there as of v9.3. While it is often possible to implement these feature via Regular Expression or XSLT, it is often inelegant and slow.

Custom Assertion is the answer to this. It is a great and simple extension mechanism that Layer7 has built.

This product is widely deployed, and probably many developers are willing to share their own work.
